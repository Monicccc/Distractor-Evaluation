Perfectly clear ice blocks weighing 140 kg and measuring 100 cmx50 cmx25 cm are available from the Clinebell Company in Colorado . Much larger clear blocks are produced in Europe and Canada or harvested from a frozen river in Sweden . These large ice blocks are used for large ice sculpting events and for building ice hotels .      Another difficulty in the process of ice sculpting is time control . The temperature of the environment affects how quickly the piece must be completed to avoid the effects of melting . If the sculpting does not take place in a cold environment , then the sculptor must work quickly to finish his piece . The tools used for sculpting also affect when the task can be finished . Some sculptures can be completed in as little as ten minutes if power tools are used . Ice sculptors also use sharp chisels    that are specifically designed for cutting ice . The best ice chisels are made in Japan , a country that , along with China , has a long tradition of magnificent ice sculptures . Ice sculptures are used as decorations in some cuisines    , especially in Asia . When holding a dinner party , some large restaurants or hotels will use an ice sculpture to decorate the table . For example , in a wedding banquet it is common to see a pair of ice - sculpted swans    that represent the union of the new couple .", "question": "What kind of ice is ideal for sculpting ?", "pre_distractor": "Ice blocks weighing 500 kg .", "answer": "Ice from clean water ."}

Even a small reduction in salt in the diet can be a big help to the heart . A new study used a computer model to predict -how just three grams less a day would affect heart disease in the United States . The result : Thirteen percent fewer heart attacks . Eight percent fewer strokes . Four percent fewer deaths . Eleven percent fewer new cases of heart disease . And two hundred forty billion dollars in health care savings . Researchers found it could prevent one hundred thousand heart attacks and ninety - two thousand deaths every year . The study is in the New England Journal of Medicine . Kirsten Bibbins - Domingo at the University of California San Francisco was the lead author . She says people would not even notice a difference in taste with three grams , or one - half teaspoon , less salt per day . The team also included researchers at Stanford and Columbia University . Each gram of salt contains four hundred milligrams of sodiu , which is how foods may list their salt content . The government says the average American man eats ten grams of salt a day . The American Heart Association advises no more than three grams for healthy people . It says salt in the American diet has increased fifty percent since the nineteen seventies , while blood pressures have also risen . Less salt can mean a lower blood pressure . New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is leading an effort called the National Salt Reduction Initiative . The idea is to put pressure on food companies and restaurants . Critics call it government interference . Mayor Bloomberg has already succeeded in other areas , like requiring fast food places in the city to list calorie information . Now a study by the Seattle Children 's Research Institute shows that the calorie information on the menu can influence what parents order for their children . Ninety - nine parents of three to six year olds took part . Half had calories between the two groups for foods that the parents would have chosen for themselves .

That 's much more than students of the US(26.4 % ) , Japan(8.2 % ) and South Korea(5.2 % ) . Who sleeps most often in class ? Japanese students fall asleep in class most often . About 45 % of them said they sometimes doze off   in class . In South Korea is 32 % ; in the US , 21 % ; and 5 % in China . South Korean students do n't like taking notes . About 70 % said they write down what the teacher says in class , many fewer than in Japan(93 % ) , China(90 % ) and the US ( 89 % ) . Who is the most distracted ? American students are the most active in class , but also the most distracted :   64.2 % said they talk with friends in class ; 46.9 % said they eat snacks   in class ; and 38.9 % said they send e - mails or read unrelated   books in class . What do they do after school ? In their free time , most Chinese students study or surf the Internet . Most American students go out with their friends . Most Japanese students do physical exercises . Most South Korean students watch TV .", "question": "In the report , who studies hardest ?", "pre_distractor": "American students .", "answer": "Chinese students ."}

Sewing machines , washing machines and tumble dries are common enough today , but a hundred years ago few people could even imagine such things . However , inventors have designed and built a wide range of household machines since then . In most cases the inventor tried to patent his machine , to stop anyone copying it . Then he tried to produce a lot of them . If the machine became popular , the inventor could make a lot of money .   In 1790 the first sewing machine was patented . The inventor was an Englishman called Thomas Saint . There was nothing to match his machine for forty years , and then someone built a similar device . He was a Frenchman , Bartelemy Thimonier . Neither of these early machines worked very well , however . It was n't until 1846 that an inventor came up with a really efficient sewing machine . He was an American , Elias Howe and his machine was good enough to beat five skilled sewing women . He did n't make much money from it , however . The first commercially successful sewing machine was patented by Isaac Singer five years later .   Today , we take washing machines for granted , but there was none before 1869 . The revolving drum of that first machine set a pattern for the future , but it was crude by today 's standards . The drum was turned by hand , and needed a lot of effort . Eight years passed before someone produced an electric washing machine . The world had to wait even longer for a machine to dry clothes .

Wind and energy from the sun are generally considered clean , unlike energy from coal - burning power stations . However , environmentalists now worry that too much solar power development could harm the local environment . A California company -- BrightSource Energy is building a huge solar power plant in the Mojave desert , about 60 kilometers southwest of Las Vegas , Nevada . The plant is known as the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System . Joe Desmond works for the company . \" This is actually one of the highest concentrations of sunlight in the world , out here in Ivanpah . \" explained Desmond . BrightSource Energy will deploy 170,000 specially designed mirrors to direct solar energy towards boilers on top of three power towers .

To make space life better , however , scientists have made breakthroughs . Earlier this year , Russian astronauts managed to grow a variety of crops aboard the station . Next year they are going to try to grow rice and other plants . And , as transporting water to space is expensive , astronauts are looking for ways to recycle water . \" Astronauts on board the ISS already drink water distilled from sweat and urine < ) , \" Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported .

Scientists have genetically modified a cat as part of an experiment that could lead to treatments for diseases . Named Mr. Green Genes , he looks like a sixmonthold cat but , under ultraviolet   light , his eyes , gums and tongue glow green . That is the result of a genetic experiment at the Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species in New Orleans , US . Mr. Green Genes is the first fluorescent   cat in the US and probably the world , said Betsy Dresser , the center 's director . The researchers made him so they could learn whether a gene could be introduced harmlessly into a cat 's genetic sequence .

Most people have strong feelings and opinions about money , based on childhood experiences and the values and beliefs of their families . Most often , these experiences , values , and beliefs are different for each parent . It is important for the healthy development of children that parents talk about these feelings and opinions and establish a consistent approach to teaching children about money . Here are some guidelines parents can keep in mind as they begin the financial socialization of their children : Advise rather than order how the child 's money should be used . Allow children to learn by mistakes and by successes . Be consistent while taking children 's differences into account . Include all family members in money management discussions , decision making , and activities suitable for their age . Explan to children what they can and can not do and the consequences of going above the limits . As children get older increasingly include them in discussions of limits and consequences . Expect all family members to perform unpaid , routine household work based on their abilities . Express your desire to have things you ca n't afford . Children need to know that parents say \" no \" to themselves , too .", "question": "Which of the following are parents advised to do ?", "pre_distractor": "Teach children that they should always say \"yes\" to their unrealistic desires.", "answer": "To help children learn to say \" no \" to their own unrealistic desires ."}

This means they are in danger of becoming extinct and living on only in the pages of history books . The famous dodo is a classic example of a creature that became extinct . A flightless bird that lived on the island of Mauritius , it was discovered by sailors in 1598 but was hunted to extinction by 1681 . Hunting has caused the Bengal tiger and the African elephant to be endangered today but habitat destruction can also lead to extinction . This is equally true for plants . Animals and plants disappear for other reasons too , but the main cause is often a disruption ( , ) in the natural food chain , whether due to hunting , habitat destruction , or even the introduction of alien species . The natural food chain is the cycle that governs the existence of all life on this planet . It is a carefully balanced cycle and any imbalance that occurs can cause knock - on effects that have serious consequences . At the beginning of the natural food chain are plants which turn sunlight into energy and draw nutrients from the earth . Plants are called producers . After the producers come the consumers . There are three tiers of consumers . First are creatures such as plant - eating animals , fish and insects which feed off the producers . These animals that only eat plants are called herbivores . The second tier of consumers are carnivores - animals that live off other animals . The third tier of consumers eats both other animals and plants . These consumers , including most humans , are called omnivores . After animals and plants die , they become food for other smaller creatures , such as bacteria and some plants , such as fungi . As they feed , these creatures turn the dead bodies back into gases and minerals which are again food for the producers at the beginning of the food chain . And so the cycle continues . All of nature is connected and governed by hundreds of these delicate food chains and if a single plant in the chain can not survive , then the insects that live off the plant start to die and the animals that eat the insects also start to die . When a food chain is disrupted , the consequences can be extremely serious . One estimate suggests that for each plant species that is lost , up to 30 animals and insects may also die out . One wonders how many species were affected by the extinction of the dodo ? Humans can have disastrous effects on food chains . We 've already mentioned hunting but now let 's look at travel . When people first started to explore the world they took plant and animal species from their home countries and introduced them wherever they went . They did n't realize that by introducing alien species they were disrupting the natural food chains of the areas they discovered . Although there are strict rules in place today controlling the import and export of alien species , some places are still fighting the effects of aliens introduced hundreds of years ago . For example , Gough Island in the South Atlantic Ocean is a breeding ground for albatrosses that have been nesting there for centuries . But in the 19th century , mice from passing ships were brought to the island . Being a species alien to the island , they had no natural predators and have now grown to such a size that they are attacking and killing albatross chicks . If they are allowed to continue , they will wipe out the albatross population . With import laws and people 's rising awareness of how humans affect the natural environment , hopefully we can learn to fit better into the natural food chains that govern our world . Otherwise we need to accept that the loss of any more plants and animals could eventually mean our own extinction .", "question": "Which of the following sentence is TRUE according to the passage ?", "pre_distractor": "Introducing alien species does not have any impact on the natural food chains.", "answer": "If a bird becomes extinct , the relevant food chain will be disrupted ."}

With popularity and interest in tea continuing to grow in recent years , many consumers have recently considered making the switch from coffee to tea , if they have not done so already . All the buzz surrounding tea and coffee may have you wondering , what are the differences ? As it turns out , the differences are many and varied . In the US , interest in tea ranges from coast to coast with the highest in Hawaii and California but stretching to the eastern states of Vermont and New York . On the other hand , the highest interest in coffee tends to be concentrated more in the north and western regions , with the highest search volumes appearing in the states of Hawaii , Washington and Minnesota . Differences between tea and coffee also vary in origin and production . All tea comes from the harvested leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant , while there are about 60 different species of coffee plants . Production of tea is quicker and more efficient : Camellia sinensis plants only need to grow for three years before they are ready to process ; coffee plants take up to five years . Perhaps the most concerning issue consumers have when considering making the switch to tea is the question of caffeine . The good news is , when it comes to tea and caffeine , there is something for everyone . Unlike coffee , which typically only comes in decaffeinated and regular , there are several varieties of tea available , based on caffeine preference . From herbal teas that are naturally free of caffeine , to high quality green and black teas that offer less than half the caffeine of coffee , to high caffeine teas such as our specially formulated HiCAF(r ) blends that contain slightly more caffeine than a cup of coffee , there is a variety sure to suit your needs . As an added bonus , the lower acidity levels in tea tend to be gentler on the stomach for a more comforting pick - me - up . So what is the answer , coffee or tea ?

The 3D glasses make the images from the screen look like they are there in the room with you . Three - dimensional , or 3D , means having three dimensions   : width , height and depth.3D technology   is based on the way the human brain   and eyes work . Because the _ of a person 's eyes are about 6.5era apart , when we look at something , each eye sees it from a different angle .Our eyes send the two images to our brain , and the brain puts them together . The small difference between the image from the right eye and the image from the left eye allows us to see depth . When we view pictures and television in two dimensions , each eye gets the same information . That is because the image has no real depth , and there is only one of viewing it . So the goal of 3D technology is to get a different image into each of the viewer . It uses two film projectors . One projects a left eye image and the other projects a right image . The 3D glasses allow us to see a different image in each eye . While watching 3D films , we feel that we are in the same environment as the things we 're watching . However , it also has its disadvantages . The 3D glasses work by controlling the amount of light that reaches the eyes . It makes the screen look darker .

Scientists have genetically modified a cat as part of an experiment that could lead to treatments for diseases .

That is the result of a genetic experiment at the Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species in New Orleans , US . Mr. Green Genes is the first fluorescent   cat in the US and probably the world , said Betsy Dresser , the center 's director . The researchers made him so they could learn whether a gene could be introduced harmlessly into a cat 's genetic sequence . If so , it would be the first step in a process that could lead to the development of ways to treat diseases via gene therapy . The gene , which was added to Mr. Green Genes'DNA , has no effect on his health , Ms Dresser said .   Cats are ideal for this project because their genetic makeup is similar to that of humans , said Dr Martha Gomez , a scientist at the center .
